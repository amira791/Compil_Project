# Compilation Project

## Overview
This project is a compiler for a custom programming language. It involves multiple stages of compilation:
- **Lexical Analysis**: Tokenizing the input source code.
- **Syntax Analysis**: Parsing the tokenized code to ensure it follows the grammar rules.
- **Semantic Analysis**: Checking for semantic correctness such as variable declarations and types.

The project is developed using C and the following tools:
- **Flex** for lexical analysis.
- **Bison** for syntax and semantic analysis.

## Project Structure
Here is a brief overview of the key files in the project:

- **lexique.lex**: The Flex file that defines the lexical rules for tokenizing the input source code.
- **lex.yy.c**: The generated C code from `lexique.lex` after running Flex. It contains the lexical analyzer.
- **syntaxe.y**: The Bison file that defines the grammar and rules for syntax analysis.
- **syntaxe.tab.c**: The generated C code from `syntaxe.y` after running Bison. It contains the parser.
- **syntaxe.tab.h**: The header file generated by Bison, which includes the token definitions.
- **SymboleTable.c**: This file manages the symbol table used during semantic analysis.
- **SymboleTable.h**: Header file for the symbol table.
- **shared.h**: A shared header file containing common definitions and includes.
- **res.exe**: The final compiled executable.
- **Output.txt**: A file that contains the output of a test run.

## How to Build the Project

To compile the project, follow these steps:

1. **Generate Lexical Analyzer**: 
    ```bash
    flex lexique.lex
    ```

2. **Generate Parser**:
    ```bash
    bison -d syntaxe.y
    ```

3. **Compile the Files**:
    ```bash
    gcc lex.yy.c syntaxe.tab.c SymboleTable.c -o res.exe
    ```

This will generate an executable `res.exe` which can be used to run and test the compiler.

## Running the Compiler

After building the project, you can run the compiler using the following command:

```bash
./res.exe <source_code_file>
